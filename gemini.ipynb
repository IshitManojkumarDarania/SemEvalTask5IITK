      "Question: 8. International incident. Tiant sues Lenoir, who lives in the Southern District of New York, and Sorrel, who lives in the Western District of Pennsylvania, for negligence in causing an auto accident in the province of Ontario, Canada. Tiant, a pedestrian from Ontario, was injured when cars driven by Lenoir and Sorrel collided and swerved off the road. He alleges that Lenoir was negligent in running a red light at the time of the accident, causing the collision with Sorrel. He claims that Sorrel was negligent in improperly repairing his brakes himself at his home in Pennsylvania, so he couldn’t avoid hitting Tiant after the collision. He brings suit in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York, and serves Sorrel with process in the action while Sorrel is visiting New York City.\n",
      "Context: One of the dangers of multiple-choice testing is that the professor may know less than she thinks she does. Here’s a question that struck me as fair, even straightforward, when I wrote it. However, only 9 percent of my students got it right. As it turns out, there’s an ambiguity in the law that I never saw until I wrote this chapter. I’ll never know whether that ambiguity led to the large number of ‘‘wrong’’ answers, but it makes an interesting study in the perils of multiple-choice testing.\n",
