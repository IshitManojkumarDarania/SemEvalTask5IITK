       "'Venue in most federal actions is governed by 28 U.S.C. §1391(b), which provides: (b) Venue in general. A civil action may be brought in— (1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction with respect to such action. Note that subsections 1 and 2 are alternatives. Venue is proper in a district where either a defendant resides (if they are all residents of the state where the action is brought) or a district in which a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place. Section 1391(b)(3) is a ‘‘fallback’’ venue provision that is only available in unusual circumstances: when there is no district, anywhere in the United States, where venue would be proper under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2). If the defendants all reside in the state where suit is brought, or if a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in some federal judicial district, or if property that is the subject of the action is found in a district, §1391(b)(3) cannot apply, because there will be at least one district in which venue is proper under §1391(b)(1) or (b)(2). Note also that there is a nasty proviso in 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) that poses a trap for the unwary: The first sentence of that subsection provides that the venue options in §1391(b) apply ‘‘except as otherwise provided by law.’’ Section 1391 is a general venue statute that applies unless there is a special venue statute for the type of claim the plaintiff brings. The United States Code has many specialized venue provisions for particular types of actions. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §1402 (tort action against the United States must be brought in the district where the plaintiff resides or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred). If there is a special venue statute for a particular type of claim, it may be interpreted as displacing the general venue choices in §1391(b)—that is, as providing alternative, exclusive venue choices for such claims—or as providing additional venue choices for those claims, along with those in §1391(b). See generally, Wright & Miller §3803. To sort out the basics of §1391(b), try the following question. Assume for all examples in the chapter that no special venue statute applies. In answering these questions, please do refer to the venue statutes. Once again, my questions are based on the assumption that you have the Federal Rules book available, so you can refer to relevant statutes and rules, rather than memorizing them. I want to test my students’ ability to apply provisions like the venue statutes or Federal Rules, rather than their memory of them. Needless to say, you should find out your professor’s policy on bringing materials into the exam before you prepare for it. If she doesn’t allow you to refer to the rules book, you obviously need to spend more time memorizing statutes and rules.'"

Comedy of errors. Laurel and Hardy are injured when they are traveling in Fields’s car in the State of Emporia and Fields collides with Gleason. Laurel and Hardy bring a diversity action against Fields and Gleason in federal court. Under Emporia case law, it is unclear whether, if Gleason and Fields were both negligent, they would be liable for their percentages of fault (several liability) or each liable for the plaintiff’s full damages (joint and several liability). The federal district judge, making her best guess at the law of Emporia on the liability of joint tortfeasors, concludes that the Emporia Supreme Court would apply joint and several liability. Consequently, after the jury finds both Fields and Gleason negligent, she holds each defendant liable for Laurel and Hardy’s full damages, rather than for reduced damages based on each defendant’s percentage of negligence. Fields appeals her ruling to the federal Court of Appeals. Gleason does not appeal. While Fields’s appeal is pending, the Emporia Supreme Court holds, in an unrelated case, that several liability is the proper rule in joint tortfeasor cases. Fields’s federal appeal is heard after the Emporia Supreme Court’s decision comes down. Fields argues that the Court of Appeals should apply several liability to his case, even though the trial judge had applied joint and several liability. Gleason, the other defendant, moves for relief from the judgment against him in the federal district court, on the ground that the judgment was based on a mistake concerning the applicable law. The federal Court of Appeals will reverse the decision in Fields’s case, and remand it for entry of a new judgment based on several liability.

       " 'Every state has ‘‘choice-of-law’’ rules to deal with this problem.<n>Federal courts faced the further problem of choosing which state’s law to use in a case like Erie.<n>It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law. 8. Your law or mine? Whitney, a Rhode Island citizen, goes skiing at a ski area in Vermont. When he purchases his lift ticket, he quickly signs a release of liability, waiving his right to sue, should he be injured due to negligence of the operator. While coming down an expert trail, he comes suddenly upon a bare spot full of rocks. He falls and is injured. He brings a diversity action against the operator in federal court in Rhode Island, basing personal jurisdiction on the fact that it had sent him an offer there for a weekend ski package that induced him to go to Vermont to ski. Assume that Rhode Island tort law refuses to enforce advance waivers of liability for negligence, unless they were individually negotiated. Assume further that Vermont tort law holds such waivers enforceable. Assume further that Rhode Island’s choice-of-law rule for tort cases is to apply the law of the place of the injury, while Vermont’s choice-of-law rule involves an assessment of the interests of the parties and states involved. It is less predictable under this balancing approach to choice of law whether the court would apply Rhode Island or Vermont law. The Rhode Island federal district judge would probably apply Vermont law to Whitney’s case, because the accident happened in Vermont. 1',\n",

Sanchez brings a diversity action against Bernstein in federal court for fraud arising out of a real estate transaction. The relevant state limitations period for fraud claims is four years.

A matter of procedure? Columbus sues Moriarty in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her. Moriarty moves to bifurcate the trial, that is, to try the issue of whether his bullet hit Columbus first—and have the jury decide it—before trying the damages issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) authorizes federal courts to order a separate trial of one or more issues ‘‘in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.’’ However, Tennessee has a state constitutional provision that has been interpreted to require a single, unified trial of all the issues in a suit. The federal judge grants the motion for a separate trial, and the jury finds that it was not Moriarty’s bullet that hit Columbus. Judgment therefore enters for Moriarty. Columbus appeals, arguing that the court should have applied the state unified-trial approach. The Court of Appeals should affirm the judgment, because Moriarty might have won in a unitary trial as well, so the Rule 42(b) decision to bifurcate is not outcome-determinative. 0',\n",

Jasper then asserted five claims. His first claim was a quantum meruit claim against Holmes for the value of the services he rendered in preparing the computer program. The second was a claim for defamation against Holmes, for claiming to Clear Code that his programming work was ‘‘abominable.’’ His third claim was against High Tech, claiming that a glitch in the computer they rented to him caused the problem in the code, causing the Holmes program to fail. Jasper alleged that, if he was liable to Clear Code, then High Tech, as the cause of the defect in the program, should end up absorbing the damages.

Chao submits no opposing materials, but submits a brief arguing that the note does not constitute a contract, because the terms are insufficiently described in it. If the judge concludes that the note meets the requirements of a valid contract, she should enter partial summary judgment for Maxwell on the issue of the validity of the written contract. 1',\n",

Perez sues the City of Atlantis, alleging that the mayor violated his First Amendment rights by demoting him from his city job to a lower-paying one because he had supported Appolonia, the losing candidate for mayor in the 2018 election. The City raises three defenses. It denies that Perez was demoted, arguing that he was transferred to an equivalent position. Second, it claims that the mayor never believed that Perez supported Appolonia, so could not have discriminated against him on that basis. Last, it claims that Perez had waived any claim for demotion when he agreed to accept his new position. The case went to trial on all three issues. The jury rendered a general verdict, finding the City liable to Perez for violating his First Amendment rights. A year later, Perez is fired.

    "context = \"\"\"There are some subtle problems in the amendment area. So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will â€˜â€˜relate backâ€™â€™ to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a new defendant to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list. After he sues, the limitations period passes. Several months later, he learns that he was mistaken, that the calls actually came from Tel-Connect, a different firm. Consequently, he moves to amend to substitute Tel- Connect as the defendant. Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will â€˜â€˜relate backâ€™â€™ to the date the original complaint was filed. â€¢ First, the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(C). â€¢ Second, the defendant being added must have â€˜â€˜received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.â€™â€™ Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. â€¢ Third, the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment â€˜â€˜knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper partyâ€™s identity.â€™â€™ Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroyâ€™s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell. But Rule 15(c)(1) requires more than that. It also requires that Tel-Connect was aware, within the period for suing and serving the complaint on Tele-Sell, that the suit had been brought, and that itâ€”Tel- Connectâ€”was actually the intended target of the suit. Whatâ€™s the point of this complex provision? It is meant to ensure that Tel-Connect, the party Leroy brings in late, had actual notice within the limitations period (plus the additional 90 days that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) gives for serving the complaint2) that Leroy intended to sue it. If it had such notice, the purpose of the limitations period has been satisfied: The added defendant was aware of the need to preserve evidence and prepare a defense, within the limitations period prescribed by the legislature. Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).\n",

Darrow names Black as the defendant. Suit is filed one month before the limitations period runs. In fact, it wasnâ€™t Black who arrested Williams, it was Officer White. The report, filled out by the booking officer, was simply mistaken. Within a few days, every officer in the precinct, including White, became aware that Black had been sued by an arrestee for excessive force, though they were not aware of the specific circumstances of the case or the identity of the plaintiff. Six months later, Black answers interrogatories sent to him by Williams, denying that he was the arresting officer.
